While the firm works rapidly to improve the customer service experience, the CTO has heard repeat complaints about lags in the trading platform or spontaneous disconnects in the 24/7 financial advising platform. While she has received lots of annecdotal evidence, she needs some concrete data to back these reports up before putting the firm's small and mighty engineering team to the task.

Your second task is to create a software architecture diagram showing how different tools can be incorporated with the current platforms and services to produce data that will help the CTO make informed decisions about what features and enhancements the engineers should work on next. 

The CTO wants the tools to automate collecting data from customer feedback and analyze software performance to help predict future painpoints and highlight current bugs. Before you start diagramming, check out this article on [how to make a software diagram](https://nulab.com/learn/software-development/what-is-an-architecture-diagram-and-why-do-you-need-one/). As with the previous task, feel free to start with pen and paper before diving into diagramming on your computer.

Your diagram should include the following:

1. The data points that the CTO will find useful in understanding performance for each of the five core services.
1. How the tools you are including as part of your diagram can give the CTO those data points.
1. A mockup of a dashboard that the CTO can use to track this performance over time.

With your diagrams at the ready, you need to put together your presentation for the CTO.
