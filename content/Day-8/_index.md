## Knowing What To Include
***
When we create our technical documentation we need to know which parts are the sum parts that make up the whole document. The first step is to determine what we are writing about. Then we need to determine who is the target audience. Once we have these two ideas defined, we can move towards creating an outline and gathering requirements.   

## Gather Requirements 

Requirements gathering is the process of collecting information about what needs to be done. We gather information from stakeholders. A stakeholder can be anyone who has interest in the project we are working on. They can be members on the leadership team or colleagues that work alongside us. More often than not, they will be project managers or technical team leaders. 

## Visual Aids

For complex designs and concepts ideas we should accompany the design with illustrations (drawings) to help the readers understand the complexity within the system.  This is common in web application architecture. For our role as technical analyst, this includes screenshots, conversation summary, steps taken by us and any referenced documentation that was used to help troubleshoot the reported problem. These are effectively your notes. Our notes should stand on their own without support. We do not know who will review our notes or what part of the world they may be in when they find our notes. We should include all the steps required to carry the problem forward with repeating unnecessary steps. 

## Regional Teams 

We may find ourselves working on international teams or issues that happen in other parts of the world. The good news is a computer in Africa is a computer. The same steps will be applicable. What will be different is the language, words and common understanding of technical conversations. Our support team or extended team could be in India and work during hours our business is not operating. This means our notes should support this team in the same way it would support a local team that works in the same building we are working in in the United States. We should be clear and concise and include all correct information for the problem we are working on. 

## Problem Scope

When we are working on a particular problem. We have to be mindful of when the project takes a turn into another space that is different from the problem we are addressing. For example, if we get a call from a customer for a password reset and they start to ask questions about account name changes and account numbers. We have to redirect the question. Normally, if we are resetting passwords, we are not able to handle account detail information. This may be handled by a separate team. Many organizations have policies that outline the least privileged access policy. Least privilege addresses data ownership.  This policy usually has permission associated with the teams and system that they can access. Following this, we will handle the password reset and transfer the call to the team that handles account changes. 

## Business Case / Requirements

A business case or requirements are a reason/task that need to be performed to complete a called out task. We have seen this many times in this course. The In class assignments have business cases / requirements. These requirements must be satisfied for the task to be completed. 
Normally a project manager will assign the task to the development team. In our case, we have to gather requirements from the customer and supporting company documents and piece together a resolution.  When we are on call, we do not need to copy the conversation word for word. We should only include relevant information to solve the problem.  We will have operational knowledge of the system and should be able to piece together a resolve based on what we know, supporting documentation and details from the caller about the problem. Collectively, these are our notes and requirements.  

## User persona

A persona is a perception we have about a person's character and what we think they may be doing, thinking or feeling.  Effectively, itâ€™s an assumption theory of what we think they know based on data (surveys, questionnaires etc.) or personal experience.  In a technical analyst role we can ask what types of customers typically call in. This will help us better understand where to focus our attention when reading supporting documentation. Additionally, we can start to build a core knowledge base. A core knowledge base can be defined as the base knowledge used to gain deeper understanding of a new topic. If we focus our attention on the top 3 or 5 types of calls we can start researching those documents and problems areas first to ensure that we are ready to handle those calls more efficiently and effectively with less support from our team.
