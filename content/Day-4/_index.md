**The Sales Cloud platform** is part of the CRM system that Salesforce offers created specificly for salespeople. Because it's our most popular product, many people say Salesforce when they actually mean Sales Cloud. Sales Cloud puts all of our customer information in one place and enables us to gain key insights leads. We can see real-time reports of how the business is handling and managing the customer relationships. 

**The Service Cloud platform** allows agents to deliver services to customers instantly. It also allows customers to initialize conversation with us from any device (e.g.email, phone, SMS, social media, self-service sites, or real-time web chats). Every channel is open agents to respond to customers inqueries. This capability allows businesses to create a seemless pipeline between customers can customer support agents. It fosters better customer care, customer relationships and creates a two-way communications stream for agent and customer interactions. 

**The Marketing Cloud platform** helps keep the technilogical landscape that is constantly shifting in tack. With artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) transforming customer experience and expectations with our products and services everyday. With each technilogical wave new data signals are created. These data signals need to be read, disected and analyze by our Marketing team. They need to be able to capture and make sense of all new data points and create customer centric value and deploy intelligent marketing strategies. Disconnected from these data sources each department make synchronizing across different team difficult. This is where Marketing Cloud helps pull all the pieces together creating a uniformed campaign collecting and centeralizing customer data.

**The Commerece Cloud platform** is a key part of the Customer Success Platform and offers ecommerce solutions for B2C (business to consumer) and B2B (business to business) customers. Commerce Cloud was created in July 2016, when Salesforce acquired Demandware, an industry leader in ecommerce sites and solutions designed with the shopper in mind. In 2018, Commerce Cloud expanded beyond B2C ecommerce with the acquisition of CloudCraze, a leader in ecommerce designed for organizations selling to business customers. Now Commerce Cloud spans across B2C and B2B and includes a direct-to-consumer (D2C) product option, to offer leading ecommerce solutions for companies looking to sell products and services online.
