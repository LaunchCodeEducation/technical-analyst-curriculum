## In Class Activity: Create a how to guide 
This activity is designed to create awareness of version control systems and presentation skills. 
We focus on creating a technical document for a novice user. Learners are encouraged to create a beginners guide to setting up a GitHub account for junior developers. This guide should include all the steps required to create a new account, removing a repository, creating teams, repository permissions, projects, issues and new repositories. This should be completed in a Google slide and shared with the Teachers Assistant (TA). The instructor and TA's will vote on the top five presentation and will review them with the class. Learner may need more than the 10-slide rule provided in the reading but are encourage to try for 10 slides.
