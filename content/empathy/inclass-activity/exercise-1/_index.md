## In Class Activity 1 - Win, Win 

In this activity, you will explore the challenges and opportunities of creating a win-win scenario for an adult learning program that covers an introduction to programming course. The course will be virtual and in a classroom. Your task is to develop a comprehensive plan that addresses the needs of both the learners and the organization around handling calls around cross cultural communications and language barriers, ensuring that the training is effective, engaging, and beneficial for all parties involved.

### Task: 
1. Start by researching and discussing the characteristics of adult learners. Consider factors such as their prior experiences, motivations, learning preferences, and challenges they might face when participating in training programs.
2. Meet with company stakeholders (Teachers Assistant and Instructor) to align the training program with the organization's goals and objectives. Identify key skills and competencies that the company wants to develop in its employees.
3. Explore strategies to create a positive and inclusive learning environment that respects the experiences and contributions of adult learners. Consider the use of icebreakers, team-building activities, and open discussions.
4. Create a presentation slide deck of your findings with charts, graphs and visual aids to help understand the problems and solutions to creating such a course.
