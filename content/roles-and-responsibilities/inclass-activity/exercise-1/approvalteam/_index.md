## Team Responsibilities 
The approval team is always busy and it take 2 minutes to approve everything in this simulated environment. They also have a 5-item limit before they can take new approvals. All approvals after 5 have hit their queue and be placed on hold. If they are working on a high priority item, no new request can be taken.  If a team does not have all the required items for the approval, they are sent back to the responsible team to collect the item required.
