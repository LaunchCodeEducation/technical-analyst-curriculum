You will get about 15 minutes to present your findings, diagrams, and thought process with the CTO. You should be prepared to walk through the following:

1. Your response road map
   1. What tools are you using and why?
   1. What are the responses that you are automating and what are your suggested scripts?
   1. How are the responses grounded in the skills introduced earlier in this course?
   1. How will your suggestions better the customers' experience?
1. Your software architecture diagram
   1. What tools are you using and why?
   1. What data can these tools produce?
   1. How will your mockup dashboard clearly illustrate what is going on to the CTO?

If you would like to make slides, you are more than welcome to do so!
