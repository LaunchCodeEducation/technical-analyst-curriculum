## Activities : Active Listening Activity 

Activity 1, students should write in their own words (roughly two paragraphs or 100 words or more) a description of what happens in the following video: [Communication Skills: Empathetic Listening - Inside Out, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t685WM5R6aM). There are no right or wrong answers. We are looking for the learners to clearly document what they hear.  For Activity 2, students should be separated into two groups and review a 3 minute video on “[How To Study Hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDV1mo7QlnA)”
