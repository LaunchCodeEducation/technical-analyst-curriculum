## Dynatrace Platforms

In section we will cover just a few of the features and capabilities of Dynatrace but there are many more to review and be familiar with when we begin working with the tool. 

1. Infrastructure Monitoring 
2. Application Security 
3. Digital Experience 
4. Business Analytics

**Infrastructure Monitoring** allows us to gain detailed analysis of the underlying systems that power the organization. These include networks, event logs and computers. We can see if systems are connected, when a system is offline (aka not connected to the network) and how many nodes (computers) are on the network.  Without tools like Splunk, Dynatrace, New Relic and ELK stack, monitoring system performance at an enterprise level would be tedious and time consuming. These tools allow us to create a centralized point of reference for enterprise infrastructure. They all visibility host, virtual machine (vms) containers (docker), networks, events and logs in a single source of truth and information collection. Dynatrace also includes features for auto discovery, DavisAI engine, metrics (i.e. cpu utilization etc.), mobile and desktop monitoring capabilities for a full spectrum of machine data analysis. 

**Application Security** allows us to detect, visualize and analyze pre and post production environments for run-time vulnerabilities analyst and security threats. Keeping applications secured (patching servers, upgrades etc.) in an enterprise environment can be labor intensive. There are a variety of attack surfaces for bad actors to attack and take control of a system. Cyber security and application security are interchangeable words/phrases and both teams should work together to ensure the applications are protected against attacks and we reduce the attack surfaces within our enterprise. 

**Digital Experience** improves our user experiences by monitoring multiple channels of information on and about the users to ensure applications are available. This includes mobile, web, IoT, and APIs experiences. Dynatrace also allows us to perform Session Replay’s ( real user monitoring) to playback a recorded user session to see exactly what the user experience was during a session removing the guesswork from the analysis.

**Business Analytics** is a growing field because of the rapidly changing technological landscape and the impact it has on business goals. As a result, business and IT units cannot be siloed or use siloed data if they want to achieve the organization’s goals. Using metrics that matter the most to business and the various teams can allow organizations to move at a quicker pace when we need to drive behavior changes based on data. Business leaders can make joint decisions based on common goals as opposed to a single department's goal or the Highest Paid Person's Opinion (Hippo). The feature of Dynatrace all real time business impact analysis and reporting and visibility of Service Level Objectives (SLO) monitoring.
