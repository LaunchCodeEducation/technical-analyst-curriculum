## Capstone Goals
1. Research and Development 
2. System Architecture and Design 
3. Technical Writing 
4. Logical Architecture 

## Capstone: Website Architecture Design Logical Architecture
Create a fictious company name and logo. Add the logo to the document that will be the technical application design. 
Using [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io) or similar tool to design the following logical architecture for a website stored in AWS. Use icons for each compoent and remember the takeaways from the topics we covered on how to create a presentation. Add the locgial design to the document once you have completed architecture. Below are the components you design should include: 

**Logical Architecture Components**
1. Web Server 
2. Appliction server failover  
3. IAM roles
4. Regions
5. Security groups
6. Databases redunancy 
7. Load balancers
8. S3 for static images 
9. Intranet access (internal webpages)
10. Internet access (public webpages) 
11. Firewalls & DMZ for public and private access 
12. VPN - employee only
13. Client Machine(s)

**Bonus** - Token based authentication for access to the companies network. What is it and why should companies use it?   

**Project: Logical Architecture for a Website Stored in AWS**
Create visual representation of the logical architecture and all of the components. We are not expecting extensive knowledge on Amason that required VPC with subnets, route tables, internet gateway and NAT Gateway but a complete understanding of a web applications dataflow and design. Create a document that can answer the following questions.  

## Platform Profile Questions
Create a document that answers the follwing questions
- Who is your target audience for the platform? 
- Which persona's do you think where used to create the technical documentation? 
- What are some of the key features or capabilities of this solution offered to these audiences?
- Web purpse does the web server have in the design?
- What is an EC2 instance?
- What consitions would qualify an S3 storage solution vs Database storage? 
- What is the role of the database?  
- What are the neccessary Identity Access Managemnt (IAM) roles for database access ? 
- Why do we need a load balancer ? 
- Why are Security Groups important? 
- What is a Virtual Private Network and why would you use one?
- What is a RSA Token and how is it used 
- What is a firewall and what purpose does it have in an organization? 
  - How is access filtered by firewalls
