## The Firm

You work for an investment firm and have an exciting meeting coming up to pitch a new customer service and system architecture to the CTO. The firm's mission is to make investing a profitable and accessible endeavour to everyone, no matter how much you have in your bank account. They live up to this mission by having both web and mobile platforms to ensure you can check your balance anytime and they have five different core services:

1. For the firm's high-profile clients (clients with over $1,000,000 in assets to invest), their portfolios are individually managed by one account manager. This account manager handles all their questions and concerns and spends each day trying to grow that client's portfolio.
1. For risk-adverse people who want to invest, have less than $1,000,000, but are nervous about it, the firm offers AI portfolios. The users do not need any investing knowledge for this particular service, because the computer handles everything for them.
1. For clients who have less than $1,000,000 to invest and are not risk adverse, the firm has an trading platform for clients to conduct their own trades.
1. For all clients, they have an ecommerce platform where clients can get highly-discounted products to manage their budgets such as cash envelopes, tax software, and budget planning notebooks.
1. Finally, all clients have access to financial advisors 24/7 who can talk about not only investments, but also retirement, personal budgets, and financial goal setting.

Clients have three different ways they can contact the firm if they need to: phone, email, and chat. 

## Your Tasks

To get your presentation in tip-top shape for the CTO, you should do the following:

1. Put together a road map for the responses customers may get based on the five services they could be asking about. Specify whether the response is coming in over email, phone, or chat and whether it is automated through Service Cloud or part of a script for the customer service team.
1. Put together a diagram for a ticketing system that will show how technical and support issues will be handled within the company. 
1. Present your diagrams and thought process.
