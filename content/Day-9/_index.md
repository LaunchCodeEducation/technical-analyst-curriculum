## Customer Interactions
***
Documenting customer interactions and support calls requires gathering essential information to ensure we can work on the problem after the call ends. Some details include: 

1. Customer name, 
2. Contact details (email, phone number etc.)
3. Product or Service 
4. Pronouns 
5. Preferred Method of communication 
6. Best time of day to call back 
7. Problem Report 
8. Problem Frequency (new, existing, known issue)  

Writing effective technical documentation and user manuals requires capturing the situation that is specific to the given event but also includes making some assumptions about what might not be stated or seen. For these assumptions we should call them out and label them clearing in our notes. For example, when a caller calls in to ask questions about a product and the caller seems to have above average knowledge about the product, we should wait for the right time to ask if they would like to talk to the product team who can better assist them with their purchase. In our notes we add “assumption - customer seemed very knowledgeable about &lt; product name here > transferred (or xfer) to product specialist team - Jordan B.”. This would capture our thoughts at the time and allow us to review our notes and a later date and remember exactly what happened and what we were thinking at that time the note was captured. 

## Lean Slide Decks

Light, Effective, Aesthetically Neat (LEAN) Slide decks are how we want to present our information in an understandable format that can be clearly understood by most readers. Light in the acronym is a reference to how many slides are in the deck and how much information is displayed on each slide. If we can, we should limit our visuals to one (1) image. When selecting the images ask yourself, does this image, without any words, speak to my topic or subject? If it does, then we have a great image and we need little to no other words on the slide and we should move to the next topic in our presentation. Our goal is to keep the presentation hyper focused and provide the most effective information possible to impact the required change(s) needed. We should also ensure every slide speaks to the goal or meeting agenda to ensure we stay on target with our expected outcome from the meeting. The effective part of our presentation refers to the details we added or removed to ensure we captured only the relevant information. We can also leave links to connected topics but we _do not_ want to allow a different or separate topic to sidebar our meeting. especially if the topic is complex or controversial. Aesthetically pleasing is asking how beautiful the images or layout of the presentation is that we give. This can include fonts, colors, shapes, charts or layout templates. These choices may take some time to work out based on the type of information we are presenting and the audience we are targeting. However, it is important to consider these and other design choices when working through the aesthetics of talking points. Lastly, neat takes us back to the light, effective and aesthetic component of LEAN. Take time to remove any imagery, colors, words or bullets points that do not serve the main topic or support any of the subtopics in the presentation. Next, review you slide count and if you have more than 15 slides, review the entire deck looking for redundancy and topic that are not complementary to the agenda. These principles take time to implement and practice but they are worth investing time and thought into to ensure we can create better presentations for our audiences. 

## Beyond Bullet Points 

Formatting and organizing documentation for clarity can help us quickly determine what our notes are about. Some tips include capitalization of text that you want to stand out, **bold**, _italic _and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">underlined </span>words. Formatting can be tricking if we are not using a rich text enabled tool. Rich Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) editors allows us to add images, clickable links and gifs, and other visually appealing design elements. Keep it simple, we are creating professional documents so we don’t want to have too many different colors, font-size and bold text. Use the color red only when it makes sense and a reader needs to see the warning pop of the page against a white background. Use bullets when the order does not matter and number when there are sequential steps to follow that depend on each other. 

## Reviewing and editing 

Our documentation should be checked for accuracy and completeness as a courtesy to our team to ensure they are able to understand the next steps. It’s also an important step in the process of escalation to other teams. Once we complete our notes, we want to take a few minutes to review what we wrote and ask ourselves if our target audience will need any additional notes, explanation or clarification. This is where we start to add more call-outs with bold words, red text or order list (list numbered from 1 to …n). A top priority in reviewing is spell checking or notes for accuracy. We should ensure we spelled everything correctly and remove any abbreviations that may not be clear to the reader. A good rule of thumb is to spell the abbreviations out once earlier in the notes and then we can use them later by abbreviations only.
