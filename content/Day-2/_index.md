## What Happens After No
***
We all will have the unfortunate privilege of interacting with someone that is difficult to work with in our personal or professional lives.. We can check our actions and behaviors to ensure we are not making the same mistake as others may have with the same customer or person (managers, co-workers, spouse etc.). Acknowledge and address objections rather than ignoring or dismissing them. Grabbing the objections off the table when they are added allow us to gain better insight and understanding of the situation. 

A “No” in business rarely means that all the facts have been considered and all options have been exhausted. It’s usually our way of protecting ourselves from the unknown outcomes from the agreement. When we offer a solution to a speaker/customer, and they refuse or reject our offer, we can ask open ended questions to see if there is something we missed. For example, A customer calls in and in anger and only wants to talk to a manager/supervisor. We ask if there is anything you can do to help and they say No. What do you do? Avoid asking if there is anything you can do because there is, you can get a manager or supervisor to talk to the caller. Instead, we should ask if we can learn more about the issue before we escalate the call to help the caller avoid repeating him or herself once they’re transferred. While documenting the call, researching the caller's history and looking for notes we can ask questions about the previous call or notes on the account For example, I see you spoke with my colleague Asia yesterday about this same issue. How long has this been a problem for you? Give the speaker room to reason and respond to your inquiry and respond with empathy and explore alternative solutions to overcome objections. 

If someone rejects your solution, remember it’s not on you or what you are offering, they are rejecting the idea’s you’ve presented. Do not take it personal. Balance the rejection with open ended questions that carry the conversation forward. Repeat their problem back and wait to see if you’ve got it right and offer your solution. If your solution is rejected then ask a follow up question to temperature check the solution and situation. For example, it seems like I don’t have all the facts right. Given what you have told me, the next step(s) for me is to  _____________.. What about this doesn’t work for you? Always remember that their anger and rejection isn’t validation for something being wrong with you.  

## Avoid These 

* Don’t ask why questions they seem accusatory
* Don’t say I know how you feel, because we have no idea
* Don’t say No, use not yet instead
* Don’t take it personally, because it’s not your fault 
* Don’t say how can I help you don’t know if you can yet

## Try These 

* Ask for a name and use their name where it makes sense
* Ask what and how questions to learn how they can help you resolve the problem
* Looks like or seems like or sounds like to capture emotions
* Try to picture what they are saying and how the story is being told to help guide your how and what question to ask 
* Wait for long pauses to jump into the conversation and ask question to help the speaker understand their thoughts and help satisfy your curiosity  

## The Importance of Taking Notes 
**“ Productive Conversations, Conference Calls, and Meetings “**

Our fast-paced professional landscape requires effective communication is the  cornerstone of our success in business . Whether we are engaging in a conversation, participating in a conference call, or attending a meeting, talking notes is a critical element of guiding action items or referring to next steps for a project or plan. It also doubles as a strategic skill that enhances comprehension, retention, and collaboration. Note-taking transforms passive listening into active participation. Jotting down key points, ideas, and questions you have and helps to prevent our minds from wandering. Try not to copy word for word, we can always go back and clean up our notes after the meeting. It's also just a good record keeping habit to get into over time.

Effective teamwork hinges on clear communication and shared knowledge sharing. Post-meeting, these notes can be shared with team members who may not have been present, ensuring everyone remains aligned and informed. The act of note-sharing cultivates an environment of transparency and inclusivity, promoting a sense of unity toward common objectives. For example, if you know one of your colleagues can not make it to class next week. You can agree to share your notes with them ahead of the class scheduled date. 

## Checklist: Taking Notes

1. What information do I need? Who needs to see these notes?
2. Record only the most important ideas and concepts. Be sure to record all vital names, dates, and definitions.
3. When in doubt about whether to take a note, consider the difficulty of finding the source again, would you be able to call them back? 
4. Screenshot and highlight key areas to solve the problem.
5. Give proper credit to any resource you used to find the answer in your ticket update record the 
    1. Title; 
    2. Published Date
    3. URL
6. Record notes in a way that you find efficient and useful for outlining the steps taken to solve the problem 
7. Check your notes for accuracy against the original material before moving on to another call (if applicable) 

## Planning or Running a Meeting 

We may be called to run a meeting for your department or present a report of our findings to a larger team.  We should get familiar with Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint Slides to build your deck and more importantly outline a meeting agenda to send to the team ahead of your meeting. Here are some key elements to get your started. 

1. Determine your purpose, what do you want you audience to know or learn 
2. Consider your audience, what do they already know about your presentation 
3. Gather the details, do you research to collect all the related information to your report 
4. Create an agenda, create an agenda for the meeting
5. Identify any collaboration that may be needed to create a holistic view of the report  
6. Stay on the time target 

Structure your presentation with an 

1. Introduction: What is the presentation about?
2. Body: How does the story unfold? 
3. Closing: What do you want your audience to learn or do? 

When building our presentation, we should try to use more images than bullets, points and words. Many of our co-workers and leadership team members want to make decisions with the best information available. We should make an attempt to ensure we have quality and not quantity in our presentations. Using charts and other visual-aids will help keep the presentation short and on topic. 

**Protip: **Keep an eye on the clock. If you notice the meeting is about to run over time, take a pause and ask if there is interest in a follow-up meeting 

## Checklist: Visuals Presentation

1. Limit each visual to a single sentence or word that can be quickly read by your audience.
2. Use a font size readable from the back of a large room.
3. Limit the number of bulleted or numbered items in lists to five or six per visual, and use numbers if sequence is important and bullets if not.
4. Keep lists in parallel structure and balanced in content.
5. Make your visuals consistent in font style, size, and spacing.
6. Consider the contrast between your text and the background to ensure the text and images are clear to those in the audience.
7. Use only one or two illustrations per visual (or slide) to avoid clutter and confusion.
8. Use graphs and charts to show data trends and timeframes.
9. Avoid overloading your presentation with so many visuals that you distract or tax the audience’s concentration: One visual for every two minutes is a common guideline.
10. Avoid using sound or visual effects in presentation software that distract from the content or may seem unprofessional.
11. Do not read the text on your visual word for word. Your audience can read the visuals; they look to us to develop the key points.
12. Match your delivery of the content to visuals. Do not put one visual on the screen and talk about the previous visual or, even worse, the next one.

## Business Writing 

We will look at the more technical side of writing in the second (2) week of the training. Business writing includes but is not limited to emails, chats servers (Teams, Slack, Discord etc.), social media posts and other documentation formats we read or consume while working on the job. While we are employed at a company our social media (Facebook, LinkedIn etc.) are considered a representation of the company. Unless otherwise stated in your post, if a reader sees your post and finds it offensive, it can be considered a representation of the company we are employed by at the time. When we post, we should be mindful of what we are posting before we post, especially if it is a controversial topic. If you are in doubt, you should consult the marketing or media department before posting. Our social profiles are public information. It’s very easy to find out where someone works since we usually post or update our LinkedIn profiles with promotions, job changes and announcements. Some organizations have a media policy that we may need to revisit and review before we post public facing articles or post. Be sure to familiarize yourself with any standing policies and review all of the onboarding documents signed upon gaining employment. 

Additionally, any communication you have on company software can possibly be reviewed, kept and secured for legal purposes. We should be mindful to only use approved communications on company own systems and equipment to ensure data is kept private and secured. Our emails should follow the same outline provided in the Presentation Checklist section with an exception on the visuals aids and bullet points. Use bullets to call out important steps or action to be taken to the senders. Try to avoid writing novels in emails since in most cases only the bullet points will be scanned or reviewed. Plan a follow-up email if several days pass before you receive a reply.
