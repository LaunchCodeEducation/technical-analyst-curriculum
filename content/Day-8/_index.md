## Knowing What To Include
***
When we create our technical documentation, we need to know which parts (articles, books, references etc.) make up the whole document. The first step is to determine what we are writing about. Then we need to determine who is the target audience. Once we have these two ideas defined, we can move towards creating an outline and gathering requirements.   

## Gather Requirements 

Requirements gathering is the process of collecting, parsing and organizing information into functional and non-functional components. We gather information from stakeholders you have a interest in the project. A stakeholder can be anyone who has interest in the successfully implementation of the project. They can be members on the leadership team, external teams, virtual teams or colleagues that work alongside us. More often than not, there will be Project Managers or Technical Team Lead that owns the project deliverables and communicates changes to the project timelines and deliverables. 

## Visual Aids

For complex designs and concepts ideas we should accompany the design with illustrations (drawings) to help the readers understand the complexity within the system.  This is common in web application architecture and database design mappings. For our role as technical analyst, this includes screenshots, conversation summaries with the customer, the initial steps taken by us to resolve this issue and any referenced documentation that was used to help troubleshoot the reported problem. These are effectively our knowledge base/notes. Our notes should stand on their own without support. We do not know who will review our notes or what part of the world our audience will be in when they find our notes, so we have to ensure we have all the technical details required for our readers. We should include all the steps required to carry the problem forward without repeating unnecessary steps. 

## Regional Teams 

We may find ourselves working on international teams or issues that happen in other parts of the world. The good news is a computer in Africa is a computer in United States (U.S.). The same steps will be applicable but the language barriers will likely be thick. What will be different is the common words and common understanding of technical conversations. Our support team or extended team could be in India and work during hours that our U.S. business is not operating. This means our notes should support this team in the same way it would support a local team that works in the same building in the United States. We should be clear and concise and include all correct information for the problems we are working on allowing our extended teams to use what we have created to solve the same problems no matter where we are geographically. 

## Problem Scope

When we are working on a particular problem. We have to be mindful of scope creep. Project scope creep happens when a project starts to change and grow beyond its original goals. This happens when we have a poorly designed project plan. For example, if we get a call from a customer for a password reset and they start to ask questions about account name changes and account numbers. We have to redirect the question to the area we are responsible for, which is resetting the password. Normally, if we are resetting passwords, we are not able to handle account detail information. This may be handled by a separate team or department. Many organizations have policies that outline the least privileged access rule. Which is a policy that describes data governance and ownership. This policy usually has permissions associated with the teams and system that they can access to in production environments. Following this, we will handle the password reset and transfer the call to the team that handles account changes. However, scope creep happens on software projects and they have the same characteristics. When this happens, we may need to put a meeting on the calendar with the project manager to discuss how to best handle the issue. 

## Business Case / Requirements

A business case or business requirements are used to help us define what the software should do and the expected outcomes of the project once the system is designed. We have seen this many times in this course in the form of in class activities and home assignments. These requirements must be satisfied for the task to be considered completed. Normally a project manager will assign the task to the development team and the developers would use Jira (a project management application) to update the status (in progress, not stated, completed) of the task. In our case, we have to gather requirements from the customer and supporting company documents and piece together a resolution.  When we are on a call, we do not need to copy the conversation word for word. We should only include relevant information to solve the problem.  We will have operational knowledge of the system and should be able to piece together a resolve based on what we know, supporting documentation and details from the caller about the problem. Collectively, these are our notes and requirements.  

## User persona

A persona is a perception we have about a person's character and what we think they may be doing, thinking or feeling.  Effectively, itâ€™s an assumption theory of what we think they know based on data (surveys, questionnaires etc.) or personal experience.  In a technical analyst role we can ask what types of customers typically call in. This will help us better understand where to focus our attention when reading supporting documentation. Additionally, we can start to build a core knowledge base and use this to help us solve problems we see during our day-to-day workflow. A core knowledge base can be defined as the base knowledge used to gain a deeper understanding of a new topic. If we focus our attention on the top 13 or top 15 types of calls we can start researching those documents and problems areas first to ensure that we are ready to handle those calls more efficiently and effectively with less support from our team.
