## Intro to Dynatrace

What is Dynatrace? Dynatrace is an analytics and automation provider for unified observability and security. The Application Performance Monitoring (APM) feature provides an automated, code-level visibility and transactional context for complex enterprise applications. It can also detect and monitor microservices across hybrid environments. We can also manage and analyze log files. With Log Management and Analytics, we can explore millions of log files across the enterprise. Similar to Splunk, Dynatrace has its own query language Dynatrace Query Language (DQL) for query data.
