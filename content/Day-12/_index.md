## Intro to Dynatrace

What is Dynatrace? Dynatrace is an analytics and automation provider for unified observability and security. The Application Performance Monitoring (APM) feature provides an automated, code-level visibility and transactional context for complex enterprise applications.

There is a large amount of detail and resources to review but we should focus on the features used by our employers. Once we are on a team, we will learn which features are owned by our team and we can concentrate our efforts and focus in the applicable areas. Keep in mind that there may be customize configurations of any of the tools that you use inside a corporate firewall. We strongly recommend that you start with the internal documents on the tool and build out from the customed base configuration to learn more.
