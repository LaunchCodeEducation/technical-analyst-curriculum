## **Activity :** Cross Culture Communications  
Instructor Notes: This activity will challenge students to think about missing system components and attributes to system design with dealing with Technical Writing. The will also have to think like a customer to address needs of potential customers that they may not have an opportunity to interact with in their normal day-to-day work. This also enforces effective communication between three different customers persona based in three different parts of the world. We could go further with this example and talk about choosing the right colors for messaging but it may get complicated and go beyond the intent of this course. Feel free to bring in examples from you experiences to talk about cross cultural communications.
