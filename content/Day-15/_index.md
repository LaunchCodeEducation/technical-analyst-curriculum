## Plan to Develop Professionally

It is critically important to continue to improve our skills and develop professionally in our careers. When we get certifications, we are communicating to our potential employers that not only have we acquired knowledge of industry standard and accepted practices, we also have the self discipline and determination to achieve goals we have set for ourselves. Certifications provide insight into best practices and well known accepted policy and procedures. Lastly, it provides us with an edge over our peers that may be in the same application pool of hiring managers. 

## Setting Career Goals 

We should be honest, without a goal we will be stuck in a dead-end job. This is just a fact of life. We should create a growth plan and measure our progress towards our goals to ensure we are not stuck anywhere we have not unconsciously decided to be positioned. Some people like to use vision boards, others like checklists or mind maps. Regardless of your technique, make a plan to create something that you want to work towards in your career. If nothing else, our goal with writing goals is to have clarity. We need to know why we are doing what we are doing everyday. We may find that our current task seems disconnected from the goal. I encourage you to create a goal before taking a job or within the first two to three (2-3) weeks after taking the job. The reason is that after a few months on the job our vision will change and we will need to be reminded or remind ourselves why we took the job in the first place. If we are able to go back to our why, we can recenter and move forward with our plan for future growth. Our plan for growth can be as simple as I want to 2x my income or as complex as I want to own my own business within a 5 year time span. The difference between simple and complex is time. It may take longer to reach one or the other but the daily activity should contribute to the goal. Everything starts with a goal. The rest of the story is about the journey we took to achieve it.

## Training and Certification

While this course does well with an introduction there is always more to learn. Some companies offer tuition reimbursements for education and/or professional development. We can use these services to gain certification in vertical or horizontal training. Vertical training is training that is alignment within our current scope of work while horizontal training is other related fields of training. There are free and paid training programs that will allow us to develop our skills in any direction that makes the most sense for us as we grow in our professions. 

## Networking Events 

Social networking events allow us to unlock our hidden potential and can provide access to little known facts. It’s also a great way for us to get introduced to other industry professionals and learn more about how others experience the same or similar industry. We can ask about their career choices, the company they work for at the time, where they’ve been in terms of the industry and where they see themselves in the future. This will afford us the opportunity to contrast and compare our growth and see if we are in the right industry or going in the right direction with our intended trajectory. Social events also provide access to people we would not normally run into in our day to day. In the early parts of our career, we should attend at least 2 social events annually until we have 4-5 years experience or we find them to be less important to our growth plans. Keep in mind that these types of events should expand and broaden your personal network but also help shape the way we think about and actualize our self image. 

## Personal Brand

Personal name brand is what you build over a period of time directly related to your work and relationships with collaborations on projects. Training and certification increase our ability to perform. We can also find mentors in the same industry, role or profession and ask them for books and preferred training courses to get a better idea of what courses to review and consider for our next steps . Additionally, we can build online portfolios to show project work and proof of concepts we have worked on as a hoppy.
