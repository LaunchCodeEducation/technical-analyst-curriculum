## Organization Structure

Before taking on a new role in an organization we must first understand the the expectations for open rolr or opportunity. This allow us to better align our daily task while also gaining a better undestanding of the organization and reporting structure. Part of this understanding includes knowledge gaps we will have about the organization and how it functions. The reporting structure is a reference to not only who we report to but which managers members of outside of our team report to in the organization. It's important to understand direct reports so we can ensure we keep our task prioritized and ensure on time delivery of assigned task and project work. You may be asked to do something from another manager outside of our team and the project could be important but it will need to be managed based on your current project priorities. We can level-set these project by tabling them with our direct reports to ensure we stay organized and focused on what matters. 

Once we are hired, we will have tasks that are provided by our direct reports but I encourage and challenge you to have a secondary agenda. During the first two weeks of your training, to gain a better understanding of your teams structure and projects review the organization chart and collect links to supporting documentation to all the application your team is responsible for and maintaining. Then block time on your calendar to read throught the documentation and take notes where you see gaps in your knowledge. Then, schedule time with a senior developer, subject matter expert (SME) or someone with in-depth application knowledge for a 30m question and answer session. This will put you ahead by about 2.5 months of others that may have joined the organization and still learning using the trial by fire method. By reviewing the organizational chart you should be able to determine who the most senior person is on the team, by reading documentation or at least knowing where to find answers to questions you have and studying system architecture you can ask how and what question to close the knowledge gaps. When you are new you have time you will likely not have ninety days after your hire date; use it wisely. Take advantage of this time and read, review and ask a lot of questions to get up to speed with other memebers on your team. This will provide an advantage and take your learning and growth to the next level as quickly as possible within the organization. These steps are repeatale no matter what role you embark on in the future.     

Direct reports or Reporting Managers could be a Project Manager, Directors, Managers or Supervisors. This is largerly determined by the type of teams we are on and what the team is assigned to work on. We may meet with them daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or quarterly based on the organizational needs. They will be responsible for assigning work to us and prioritizing assigned tasks. This is normally done through stand-up meetings that help to discuss ongoing project work. The cadence of the meeting's frequency is determined by the type of project we are working on and the department leadership. Stand up meetings allow us to table problems, challenges and work completed for a given project. We should use these meetings to ask for help when and where we need it. A typical report the 3x3x3 rule. 

1. 3 Accomplishments from last week  
2. 3 Things on working on the current week/sprint
3. 3 Potential Problems / Concerns for the current week/sprint / Or any blockers  

This rule provides a framework for how I would capture work and report during a typical two (2) week sprint/stand-up. Going into a stand up meeting, we should ensure we have a clear understanding of what is expected of us and the task we are reporting on and action items discused about during current sprint. If we are not clear on concepts or ideas, we should annotate them and find out who is the best person to talk to after the meeting. Once we identify a person or gropu we can start to ask question and determine if we need to triage our problem to an internal team lead or manager. Problem escalation/triage is a process that is defined differently for each team. We should find out how probles should be moved between teams before we hand if off to another team. We should also do our due diligence to address the problem, add notes, document setps taken and how to create tickets for external teams before escalation of an issue. Lastly, Due diligence may vary based on the problem type but at a minimum our research should include but is not limited to 

* Screenshots
* Links to troubleshooting documentation used  
* Customer Name 
* Problem Description 
* Steps taken to resolve
* Escalation team and reason for escalation 

There are other variables that should be considered when creating a problem ticket that will be specific to the company or teams we are working on. It is wise to make ourselves aware of how the team operates and how information flows between teams. It is also important to understand how our team currently handles incoming requests, where to find supporting documentation, how to escalate issues and when to escalate an issue during our first few weeks in the organization. With these foundational principles, we should be able to become self-sufficient in fewer weeks than normally allotted for new hires. 

Ticket Follow up. We may need to follow up on tickets we submit to ensure the problem was handled, closed or if any additional details are required. It's also helpful to tie issue together if another customer calls in about the same issue. We can combined the issue and centralize ongoing reporting on the same issue instead of creating duplicate tickets. Many ticketing systems will have a unique identifier (UID) that is numerical value that allows us to look up tickets we have submitted. They often also include the ticket status and person working on it in the event that you need to reach out to them via chat messaging system.

Once the issue has been reported it will be assigned to someone to work on it. We can send a note to the ticket owner if we want to know more about the ticket or to ask or answer specific questions or need clarification in comments or steps made on the issue.
