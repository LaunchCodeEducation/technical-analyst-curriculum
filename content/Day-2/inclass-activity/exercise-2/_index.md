### In Class Activity 2 : Create a presentation report 
In this activity students will create a visual presentation about their career journey up until the point of enrollment into the Technical Analyst course. The presentation should be no longer than 10 slides and use visual elements to help us understand the problems, solution and any obstacles/challenges they overcame on their journey. Students are required to send chat messages (Slack messages) to the Teach Assistant that will act as the mentor for this activity. Once the slide deck is completed, it should be sent to the CEM to be added to the learner's profile for use during the final week of the course.
