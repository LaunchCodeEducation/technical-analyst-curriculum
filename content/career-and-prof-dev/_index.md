## Plan for Professional Development

Continuing to improve our skills and professional development is critically important in our careers. Certifications signal to potential employers that we not only possess knowledge of industry standards and best practices but also exhibit self-discipline and determination to achieve our set goals. Certifications offer insights into best practices, accepted policies, and procedures, giving us an edge over our peers in the hiring pool.

## Setting Career Goals

Honesty is keyâ€”without goals, our efforts lack direction. Working without a purpose means any job will suffice, regardless of the task. Create a growth plan, measure progress, and ensure conscious alignment with our goals. Some prefer vision boards, checklists, or mind maps; regardless of the technique, crafting a career-oriented plan fosters clarity, vision, and direction. We should understand the "why" behind our daily actions, as nothing has meaning until we assign it. If our current tasks seem disconnected from our goals, it may be time to review and realign them. I encourage you to establish goals before or within the first two to three (2-3) weeks of starting a job. This ensures we maintain our initial vision and continue moving forward with our growth plan. Goals can be as simple as doubling income or as complex as starting a business within five years, with the difference being the time required. Regardless, daily activities should contribute to achieving the goal. Everything begins with setting a goal; the rest is about the journey to achieve it.

## Training and Certification

While this course provides a good introduction, more learning opportunities are always available. Some companies offer tuition reimbursements for education and professional development. Utilize these services to gain certifications in vertical or horizontal training. Vertical training aligns with our current work, while horizontal training explores related fields and technologies. Free and paid training programs help us develop skills in any direction that makes the most sense for our professional growth. Always inquire about company-sponsored learning and training for professional development.

## Networking Events

Social networking events help us unlock our hidden potential and provide access to little-known facts and specialized knowledge. They also introduce us to industry professionals, allowing us to learn from their experiences. We can inquire about their career choices, the companies they work for, their industry journeys, and future aspirations. This comparison helps us evaluate our growth plan and ensure we are on the right trajectory in our chosen industry. Social events connect us with people we might not encounter in our daily routines. In the early stages of our career, attending at least two social events annually is beneficial, typically until we gain 4-5 years of experience or find them less essential to our growth plans. These events expand our personal network and shape our self-image.

## Personal Brand

A personal brand develops over time through work and collaborations on projects. Training and certification enhance our performance and decision-making based on best practices. To build our personal brand, we can seek mentors in the same industry, role, or profession and ask for recommended books and training courses. Online portfolios showcase project work and concepts we've worked on as hobbies or passions. Building a personal brand is crucial, and we should invest in building our network for personal growth and development.
