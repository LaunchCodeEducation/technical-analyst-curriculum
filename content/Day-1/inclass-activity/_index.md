## Activities : Active Listening versus Empathetic Listening 

### Activity 1
Students should write in their own words (roughly two paragraphs or 100 words or more) a description of what happens in the following video, [Communication Skills: Empathetic Listening - Inside Out, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t685WM5R6aM). There are no right or wrong answers. We are looking for the learners to clearly document what they hear.  

### Activity 2
Students should be separated into pairs and review a situation. After a team discussion, they should present their findings on how active listening can be used to rectify the situation and ensure the customer has a good experience.
