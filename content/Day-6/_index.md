What is Technical Writing? It is the crafting of technical content that provides detailed steps on how to approach and solve a problem. The importance of documentation in engineering lies in knowledge preservation and sharing. When members of our team encounter unfamiliar systems or technologies, they can refer to the documentation to gain a better understanding of how the system functions. More significantly, they can formulate questions about the functionality of methods and design plans based on their existing knowledge.

Many organizations have already documented their processes, design plans, technical architecture, and logical and physical designs. Our task is to familiarize ourselves with this documentation and have our colleagues help fill in any knowledge gaps as we become better acquainted with the systems and workflows within the organization.

Documenting customer interactions and support calls is a valuable form of documentation that aids in sharing the knowledge acquired during a call with other team members throughout a workweek. This enables them to review our notes and determine the next logical steps to resolve the issue without retracing previously taken steps. Writing effective technical documentation, user manuals, or call notes follows a consistent process that includes, but is not limited to:

- Formatting and organizing documentation for clarity.
- Reviewing and editing documentation for accuracy and completeness.
- Understanding our audience (readers).
- Utilizing visual aids.
- Providing step-by-step instructions and conditional callouts.

## Writers Framework 

Our first steps help us create the framework for our documentations and determine what we are writing about, who we are writing for and what we want our readers to know before we start writing. These are the fundamental parts of our writing. This is a universal framework that we can use to create presentations, research papers, fiction and non-fiction artifacts. 

### Writers Framework 
1. Who needs to read this document?    
2. When should they read this document and what should it include/exclude?
3. What is the document about? 
4. How can they use this information going forward?  
5. Identify Key Points or Objectives 

### Situation: Using The Writers Framework For Password Reset 

**A customer password reset** password reset is the most common help desk issue. It’s also the easiest one to resolve. Let’s walk through an example of a framework. We work in a call center and we get multiple calls a day. Assume that we have a note taking application for call notes and a knowledge management system for research. You are a Technical Service Analyst and you receive a call for a password reset. 

**Note:** this is a simple example that may exist in smaller organizations. In a larger organization you will use several knowledge management systems and potentially two or three ticketing systems for reporting issues. For our example, we are keeping things simple. 

### 1. Who needs to read this document

We may have two different people in attendance (our audience). For the sake of this example, let’s call these two audience members Tier 1 Help Desk and Tier 2 Support. We could be writing for both our team members and the escalation team so we should include all relevant screenshots and capture notes for each respective team to review.  Using what we’ve learned from [Module 1 Effective Communications](../Day-1/_index.md), we can gather more information about the issue by asking open ended questions about the reported issue and what the customer is experiencing. Then using active listening to tune into anything that sounds like a larger issue. For example, if the caller/client says I got a 404 message several times when trying to login but it worked after the fifth (5) try when I refreshed the browser. This could mean there’s an issue with the application routing and should be escalated to the network or application team for further analysis. 

### 2. When should they read this document 

This document can be used as a reference document and can be used to reset a user's password at the Tier 1 level of support. It does not include changing a user’s login name/details or account information. If the user needs to complete any steps other than password reset for their account, they should be escalated to Tier 2 Support. 

### 3. What is the document about 

In this section we show them how to properly authenticate and verify a user before resetting the user’s password. It includes the required firewalls to log into and what application should be used to reset the user’s password, and how to verify successful password changes. This section will also detail the self-service steps that allow users to reset their own passwords. 

### 4. How can they user this information going forward

Technical analysts can skip all the previous steps above and work with the development team to create a self-service solution that allows our users to reset their passwords using the self-hosted and self-service application. 

### 5. Identify Key Points or Objectives

The purpose of this document is to reduce the Mean Time To Respond (MTTR) in password reset calls with a document that captures the required steps for Technical Analyst to complete this task. 

## Learner Profile (Technical, non-technical)

A learner's profile (aka target audience) is another approach for technical writing in that we are often writing for both technical and non-technical users. This means we must take a different approach when explaining complex technical designs and design presentations if our learner's profile is for a non-technical reader. We should also stay away from using industry jargon, which are the standard words and terminology used by professionals in the particular field. For example, a sales team would use words that make sense to other sales people but may not mean the same thing if that sales person was talking to a software engineer and vice versa. This means our technical writing should include charts and other visual aids to help express our message. We may be writing for developers, engineers or executives leadership teams (Vice President (VP), Chief Executive Officer (CEO) etc.). We should ensure our audience can keep up with the key points of the presentation and not get hung up on words and terms we have used to explain a concept.

1. Will anyone in your audience have preexisting knowledge of the content in your presentation? 
2. Will you have any Subject Matter Experts (SME’s) in the room? 

If either of the previous questions are true, we have to addressed their potential concerns or invited the SME to help with the presentation. We need to know how to best tell our story rather than provide bullet points and text on the screen or in an email. Another consideration is with font-size. We want our font to be readable and consider that some team members may be color blind or wear glasses. That means if we highlight text in a particular color like red. We may want to ensure we consider other colors or explain what the red color represents in our communication to the team. There are many types of readers to consider and we do not have to try to remember them all but we should be familiar with accessibility standards. You can read more about [web accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for web based documentation but also should be aware of the other types of accessibility in reference to documentation that we create for mass consumption. Some accessibility areas include but is not limited to:  

* Font-Size 
* Colors 
* Language 
* Proper Headings 
* Text Readability 
* Image alternate text

## Presentation and Visual Impact 

> “ I hate it when people use PowerPoints instead of thinking. People confront a problem by creating a presentation. I want them to engage,  hash things out at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides. People who know what they’re talking about don’t need PowerPoint.” – Steve Jobs

Although Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos banned PowerPoints, many organizations still use this form of communication for many different reasons. One of the most important things to decide on the color palette. Using approved colors or similar colors we have seen on other presentations in the organization is a good rule of thumb. Often, the marketing team has already created templates that should be used for both internal and external communications. When deciding on colors pick three to four main colors for the following areas: 

1. Text, 
2. Headings, 
3. Shapes/Images and 
4. Call outs. 

We want to avoid lots of text on the screen and use as little text as possible along with our images. We should also ensure the text size is larger enough to see from the back of a large room. Engagement with our presentation should be driven by the calls to action or call outs to items we want to bring attention to in a visual. For example, assume we had a sale chart for twelve (12) months and there is a month that has a negative impact on the total months. We could highlight the negatively impacted month in red and make other areas a ligher pink color to bring the viewers attention directly to the point of the presentation when the slide is shown. Highlighting this month may bring questions or it may be the central point of your argument. Pay keen attention to details for both internal and external influences on your visuals. 

There could be outside factors acting on our data. For example, if the sales data in the previous example was covering iPhone sales, we may notice that sales increased in December of a given calendar year. Does this mean many people got new iPhones for Christmas? Also, be mindful of what is not included, like cell phone providers. We don’t know which mobile phone providers had the most sucess in this calendar year. Are all the phone providers doing well during this holiday season or just one? Are all the providers lump in together? We must do our due diligence when reporting because our slides may be shared between teams, departments or publicly and we want to answer as many questions as we can in our presentation. Remember, always save 10-15 minutes at the end of a presentation for questions and answers (Q&A). There could be a room full of people waiting to the end of the presentation to ask questions but they wanted to get the full picture before jumping into a conversation.
