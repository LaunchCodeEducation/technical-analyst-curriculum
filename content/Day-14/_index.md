## Organization Structure

Before taking a role in an organization we must first understand the what of the role so we can better align our task to achieve the organizational goal and the reporting structure. The reporting structure is a reference to not only who we report to but who members of our team report to in the organization. It's important to understand direct reports so we can ensure we keep our task prioritized and ensure on time delivery of assigned task and project work. Once we are hired on to the company we will have tasks that are provided by our direct reports, however I challenge you to have a secondary agenda that will help you gain a better understanding of team structure and project management tasks by reviewing the organizational chart, reading documentation or at least knowing where to find answers to questions you have and studying system architecture. When you are new you have time you will likely not have ninety days after your hire date. Take advantage of this time and read, review and ask a lot of questions.  This will provide an advantage and take your learning and growth to the next level as quickly as possible within the organization.    

Direct reports or Reporting Managers could be a Project Manager, Manager or Supervisor that we meet with daily, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. They will be responsible for assigning work to us and prioritizing our tasks. This is normally done through stand-up meetings that help to discuss ongoing project work. The cadence of the meeting's frequency is determined by the type of project we are working on and the department leadership. Stand up meetings allow us to table problems, challenges and work completed for a given project. We should use these meetings to ask for help when and where we need it. 

Going into a stand up meeting, we should ensure we have a clear understanding of what is expected of us and the task we are reporting on. If we are not clear on concepts or ideas we should annotate them and find out who the best person to talk to about finding a resolution or problem escalation. Problem escalation is a process that is defined differently for each team. We must do our due diligence to address the problem. Due diligence may vary based on the problem type but at a minimum our research should include but is not limited to 

* Screenshots
* Links to troubleshooting documentation used  
* Customer Name 
* Problem Description 
* Steps taken to resolve
* Escalation team and reason for escalation 

There are other variables that should be considered when creating a problem ticket that will be specific to the company or teams we are working on. It is wise to make ourselves aware of how the team operates and how information flows between the teams. It is important to understand how our team currently handles incoming requests, where to find supporting documentation, how to escalate issues and when to escalate an issue. With these four (4) foundational principles, we should be able to become self-sufficient in fewer weeks than normally allotted for new hires. 

Ticket Follow up. We may need to follow up on tickets we submit to ensure the problem was handled but also to know if another customer calls in about the same issue we can update the ongoing issue instead of opening duplicate tickets. Many ticketing systems will have a unique identifier (UID) that is numerical and allows us to look up tickets we have submitted. They also include that ticket status and person working on it. 

**Pro Tip:** Once the issue has been reported it will be assigned to someone to work on it. We can send a note to the ticket owner if we want to know more about the ticket or to ask or answer specific questions about the ticket.
