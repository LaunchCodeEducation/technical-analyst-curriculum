## Capstone Introduction
The Capstone for the course is designed to invoke and help you gain exposure to research and development (R&D) with technical analysis. It is recommended that you use Amazon Web Service (AWS) as it is the most popular platform. However, you can choose any cloud provider of your choice. You will need to create a presentation that will contain at least one of the following features. 

*You may include more than one but at least one is required.*

## Project Features 
1. Load Balancers Architecture (Web Front-End)
2. Virtual Machines with Packer Images (Windows or Linux)

## Class Material and Resources
We have curated a list of resources for you to start reviewing. This is not an all-inclusive list, but it creates the foundation for many of the features you will need to get started. We recommend that you start reviewing these resources this week as they will build upon each other as you start to better understand system architecture. One of your goals to successfully complete the Capstone is to combine the communication between the concepts below in a visual presentation and explain the data flow of the application.
