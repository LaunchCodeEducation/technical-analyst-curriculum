## Technical Writing ( Day 1 )

What is Technical Writing, it is the writing of technical content with detailed steps on how to approach or solve a problem. The importance of documentation in engineering is knowledge preservation and sharing. When members of our team are unfamiliar with a system or technology they can read the documentation to learn more about how the system functions. Perhaps more importantly, they can form questions about the functionality of methods and design plans based on their existing knowledge. Many organizations have already documented the processes, design plans, technical architecture, logical and physical designs. Our task is to get familiar with the documentation and have our colleague help fill in any knowledge gaps as we get better acquainted with systems and workflows within the organization. 

Documenting customer interactions and support calls is a form of documentation that can help share the knowledge of a call with other team members during a given work week. They can review our notes and discern the next logical steps to take to help resolve the issue without repeating previous steps.  Writing effective technical documentation, user manuals or call notes follow the same process which includes but is not limited to

* Formatting and organizing documentation for clarity
* Reviewing and editing documentation for accuracy and completeness
* Knowledge of our audience (readers)
* Visual aids 
* Step-by-step instructions and conditional call outs 

## Writers Framework 

Our first steps help us create the framework for our documentations and determine what we are writing about, who we are writing for and what we want our readers to know before we start writing. These are the fundamental parts of our writing. This is a universal framework that we can use to create presentations, research papers, fiction and non-fiction artifacts. 

Writers Framework 
1. Who needs to read this document?    
2. When should they read this document and what should it include/exclude?
3. What is the document about? 
4. How can they use this information going forward?  
5. Identify Key Points or Objectives 

### Situation: Password Reset 

A customer password reset

Password reset is the most common help desk issue. It’s also the easiest one to resolve. Let’s walk through an example of a framework. We work in a call center and we get multiple calls a day. Assume that we have a note taking application for on call notes and a knowledge management system for research. You are a Technical Service Analyst and you receive a call for a password reset. 

**Note:** this is a simple example that may exist in smaller organizations. In a larger organization you will use several knowledge management systems and potentially two or three ticketing systems for reporting issues. For our example, we are keeping things simple. 

### Who needs to read this document

we may have two different people in attendance (our audience). For the sake of this example, let’s call these two audience members Tier 1 Help Desk and Tier 2 Support We could be writing for both our team members and the escalation team so we should include all relevant screenshots and capture notes for the team to review.  Using what we’ve learned from Module 1 Effective Communications, we can gather more information about the issue by asking open ended questions about this issue they are experiencing. Then using active listening to tune into anything that sounds like a larger issue. For example if the caller/client says I got a 404 message several times when trying to login but it worked after the fifth (5) try when I refreshed the browser. This could mean there’s an issue with the application routing and should be escalated to the network or application team for further analysis. 

### When should they read this document 

This document can be used as a reference document and can be used to reset a user's password at the Tier 1 level of support. It does not include changing a user’s login name/details or account information. If the user needs to complete any steps other than password reset for their account they should be escalated to Tier 2 Support. 

### What is the document about 

In this section we show them how to properly authenticate and verify a user before resetting the user’s password. What firewalls to log into and what application should be used to reset the users password, and how to verify successful password changes. This section will also detail the self service steps that allow users to reset their own passwords. 

### How can they user this information going forward

Technical analysts skip all the previous steps and have the user reset their passwords using the hosted self-service application. 

## Learner Profile (Technical, non-technical)

Learner profile (aka target audience) another approach for technical writing in that we are writing for non-technical users. This means we must take a different approach when explaining complex technical designs and design presentations. We should also stay away from using industry gardon (or explain gardon) , which are the standard words (terminology) used by professionals in the particular field. For example, a sales team would use words that make sense to other sales people but may not mean the same thing if that sales person was talking to a software engineer and vice versa. This means our technical writing should include charts and other visual aids to help express our message. We may be writing for developers, engineers or executives leadership teams (Vice President (VP), Chief Executive Officer (CEO) etc.). 

Will anyone in your audience have preexisting knowledge of the contents in your presentation? Will you have any Subject Matter Experts (SME’s) in the room? If so, have you addressed their concerns or invited the SME to help with the presentation? We need to know how to best tell our story rather than provide bullet points and text on the screen or in an email. Another consideration is with font-size. We want our font to be readable and consider that some team members may be color blind or wear glasses. There are many types of readers to consider and we do not have to try to remember them all but we should be familiar with accessibility standards. You can read more about [web accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for web based documentation but also should be aware of the other types of accessibility in reference to documentation that you are creating. Some accessibility areas include but is not limited to 

* Font-Size 
* Colors 
* Language 
* Proper Headings 
* Text Readability 

## Presentation and Visual Impact 

“ I hate it when people use PowerPoints instead of thinking. People confront a problem by creating a presentation. I want them to engage, hash things out at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides. People who know what they’re talking about don’t need PowerPoint.” – Steve Jobs

Although Steve Jobs banned PowerPoints many organizations still use these for many different reasons. One of the most important things to decide is on colors. Using approved colors or similar colors we have seen on other presentations is a good rule of thumb. Often, the marketing team has already created templates that need to be used for both internal and external communications. When deciding on colors pick three to four main colors for 

1. Text, 
2. Headings, 
3. Shapes/Images and 
4. Call outs. 

We want to avoid lots of text on the screen and use as little text as possible along with our images. We should also ensure the text size is larger enough to see from the back of a large room. Engagement with our presentation should be driven by the calls to action or call outs to items we want to bring attention to in a visual. For example, assume we had a sale chart for twelve (12) months and there is a month that has a negative impact on the total months. We could highlight the negatively impacted month to bring the viewers attention directly to the point of the presentation when the slide is shown. Highlighting this month may bring questions or it may be the central point of your argument. Pay keen attention to details for both internal and external influences on your visuals. There could be outside factors that are acting on your numbers. For example, if the sales data in the previous example was covering iPhone sales, we may notice that sales increase in December. 

Does this mean many people got new iPhones for Christmas? Also, be mindful of what is not included, like cell phone providers. We don’t know from this example if there are several providers doing well? Are all the providers lump in together?  We must do our due diligence when reporting because our slides (should you choose to create them) may be shared between teams and departments and we want to answer as many questions as we can during our presentation. Remember to save room for questions at the end of your presentation. There could be a room waiting to ask questions but wanted to get the full story before jumping into a conversation. 

**Pro tip:** Turn failure into stepping stones. 

Don’t be afraid to show what you learned or where the project failed. This can help others engage in the conversation or get involved in the conversation or project. 

**Pro tip:** Try to send the presentation to the group ahead of the meeting at least 24 hours at most 72 hours in advance to allow people time to review the deck before the meeting.
