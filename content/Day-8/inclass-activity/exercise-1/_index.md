## In Class Activity : Business Case

HatTrick Logic is a gaming company that needs to address its user base (age 18-25) with new features, changes and game updates. They have a diverse customer base in three (3) parts of the world, North America, Asia and Africa. They want to deploy new applications during low peak times but the time zones and language barriers makes this challenging for each location. You have been hired to create a visual diagram between the three locations and identifying what each customer base needs to help the leadership team make the final decision on the messaging system. Your diagram must include a communication/notification system that will be used to send notifications between the three company locations.
