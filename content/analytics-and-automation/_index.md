## Intro to Dynatrace

What is Dynatrace? Dynatrace is an analytics and automation provider for unified observability and security. The Application Performance Monitoring (APM) feature provides automated, code-level visibility and transactional context for complex enterprise applications. It can detect and monitor microservices across hybrid environments, which include servers that are on-premises and in the cloud. We can also manage and analyze log files on connected devices to troubleshoot reported issues. With Log Management and Analytics, we can explore millions of log files across the enterprise with a single application interface. Similar to Splunk, Dynatrace has its own query language, Dynatrace Query Language (DQL), for querying data and viewing results.

Dynatrace offers a rich feature set that we can deploy to align our observation strategies with practical and actionable business intelligence. Below is a list of features Dynatrace offers, along with a screenshot of a more detailed list of features to give you an idea of the tool's capabilities. We will focus on four key areas highlighted in the list below:

* **Digital Experience Monitoring**
* **Business Intelligence**
* Automation
* **Infrastructure Monitoring**
* Log Analytics
* Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
* **Application Security (AppSec)**

## Dynatrace Documentation
[Dynatrace Support](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help) is a general area of interest worth exploring to discover how the platform operates. It outlines how to extend and utilize the platform and Application Programming Interface (API), deployments, and solutions. There is a large amount of detail and resources to review, but we should focus on the features used by our employers. Once we are on a team, we will learn which features are owned by our team, and we can concentrate our efforts and focus on the applicable areas. Keep in mind that there may be customized configurations of any of the tools that you use inside a corporate firewall. We strongly recommend that you start with the internal documents on the tool and build out from the customized base configuration to learn more.
