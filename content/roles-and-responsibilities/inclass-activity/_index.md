## Activity : Chaos Monkey Challenge (60m)

In this activity learners are introduced to the "Chaos Monkey" inspired by Netflix. The objective is to create awareness to the adaptability, resilience, and problem-solving skills in the face of unexpected disruptions. For optimal impact you should have at least these 5 groups. Each team will need to designate 1 member to keep track of timer and workload capacity for the team.

1. Approvals Team 
2. Business Team 
3. Development Team  
4. Operations Team 
5. Security Team
   
The class should be broken up into groups of 2-5 members based on the classroom size. Every 5 minutes, one member from each team is switched to another team or removed from the activity and become a spectator or time keeper.
