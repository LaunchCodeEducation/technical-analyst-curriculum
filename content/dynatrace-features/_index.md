## Dynatrace Platforms

Monitoring the health of the organization's view dashboard is one of the many ways we can help business leaders make informed decisions. If we use the principles of LEAN visualizations, we can create powerful dashboards and reports. In this section, we will cover just a few of the features and capabilities of Dynatrace, but there are many more to review and become familiar with when we begin working with it as an administrator or developer.

1. Infrastructure Monitoring
2. Application Security
3. Digital Experience
4. Business Analytics

**Infrastructure Monitoring** allows us to gain a detailed analysis of the underlying systems that power the organization. These include networks, event logs, and computers. We can see if systems are connected, when a system is offline (aka not connected to the network), and how many nodes (computers) are on the network. Without tools like Splunk, Dynatrace, New Relic, ELK stack, and others, monitoring system performance at an enterprise level would be tedious and time-consuming. These tools allow us to create a centralized point of reference for enterprise infrastructure. They all have host visibility dashboards, virtual machines (VMs), containers (Docker), network monitoring, events, and log files in a single source of truth and information collection capability. Dynatrace also includes features for auto-discovery, the DavisAI engine, metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, etc.), and mobile and desktop monitoring capabilities that provide a full spectrum of machine data analysis.

**Application Security** allows us to detect, visualize, and analyze pre and post-production environments for runtime vulnerabilities, security threats, and vulnerabilities. Keeping applications secured (patching servers, upgrades, etc.) in an enterprise environment can be labor-intensive. There are a variety of attack surfaces for bad actors to exploit and take control of a system. Cybersecurity and application security are interchangeable terms, and both the Cyber Security and Application Developer teams should work together to ensure the applications are protected against attacks and reduce the attack surfaces within our enterprise resources.

**Digital Experience** improves our user experiences by monitoring multiple channels of information on and about the users to ensure applications are available. This includes mobile, web, Internet of Things (IoT), and API experiences. Dynatrace also allows us to perform Session Replays (real user monitoring) to playback a recorded user session to see exactly what the user experience was during a session, removing the guesswork from the analysis.

**Business Analytics** is a growing field because of the rapidly changing technological landscape and the impact it has on business goals. As a result, business and information technology teams cannot be siloed or use siloed data if they want to achieve the organizational goals. Using metrics that matter the most to business and cross-functional teams allows an organization to move at a quicker pace when they need to drive behavior changes based on new data models. Business leaders can make joint decisions based on common goals as opposed to a single department's goal or the highest-paid person's opinion (HIPPO). The features of Dynatrace allow real-time business impact analysis, reporting, and visibility of Service Level Objectives (SLO) monitoring.
