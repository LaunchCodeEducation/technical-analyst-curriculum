Reflection Questions:

Why was the yellow character (Joy) unsuccessful in helping the character Bing Bong (the Elephant)? What was wrong with her approach? 

Why was the character Sadness able to get Bing Bong to talk? What was different about her approach? Why was it successful? What do you think would have happened if Sadness was not there to empathize with Bing Bong?
