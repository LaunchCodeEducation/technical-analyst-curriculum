## Instructors Chaos List & Chaos Selection
In this activity, you and the TA's are part of the Security Analyst team. One of you will pull an item from the Chaos List and allow one member from the team to come up in front of the class and read the problem and responsible teams. One team at a time is selected to read aloud and to reveal the disruption. Each team is responsible for implementing the new business strategy for the problem. Allow the team 10 minutes to address the disruption as creatively and effectively as possible. Each situation includes the story points required to complete the task. These points are used to reduce employee burnout. Each team has a maximum of 25 Story points. Any points above this have a negative impact on performance and quality. For task greater than 10 points you can assign multiple members to work on the task using a collaboration tool like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. You can introduce items for both list at the same time or at different times it's your class. Have fun!

## Instructor Notes:
Once the activity ends discuss that in a real world situations the teams would have months to apply changes and have legal and compliance teams that will having conversations at higher levels of the organization before they become concerns for the enterprise. Also, highlight that some changes are faster than others and will have a more immediate impact like what was introduced in this simulated environment. If the development team builds a Web application, ask them why? There should have been a red flag when the QR code and permissions for camera access.
